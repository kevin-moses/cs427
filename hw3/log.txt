            I discussed this assignment with: Vivek Katara, David Schwartz, Katherine Arackaparambil, ULA (Omar)

Major Difficulties: The most difficult part of the pset was conceptual and was just figuring out where to start - that meant learning move/copy constructors and asssignment operators from the ground up. I realized early on if I use a 1-D array the vector template that Prof. Glenn demonstrated in class works remarkably well as a basis for our Matrix Code. Obviously it took a little bit of finesse to figure out the indices of slices and iterators in a matrix vs in a straightforward vector, but I found the hardest part was consistently dealing with pointers (relearning old CPSC223 lessons), dealing with const and nonconst values, and how to split up which objects get which private data members and member functions.
