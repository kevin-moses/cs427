            I discussed this assignment with: David Schwartz, ULA (Omar)

Major Difficulties: The hardest thing was handling exceptions and what to define as a graceful exit. I didn't fully understand the syntax in C++ of when to "throw" an exception versus when to "catch" one, and what to do when you catch one. I went to office hours to talk to Omar about this, and he explained that things like invalid argument or out of range are just classes of the exception object - i totally was unaware that exceptions themselves were objects! I implemented throwing exceptions in my object member functions, and seemed to pass all public tests. It might be hard to cover every single exception but I think i nailed down what could be going wrong.
