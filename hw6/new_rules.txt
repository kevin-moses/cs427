Welcome to Yortzee!

Yortzee is played like Yahtzee, but with a different collection of categories
and bonuses.  The categories and their abbreviations are: Aces (1),
Deuces (2), Treys (3), Fours (4), Fives (5), Sixes (6), Two Pair (2P),
Three of a Kind (3X), Four of a Kind (4X), Full House (FH), Low Straight (LS),
High Straight (HS), Yatzie (Y), Chance (C), and Yortzee (Z).

Basic scoring rules for Aces through Sixes, Three of a Kind, Four of a
Kind, Full House, and Chance are the same as for Yahtzee.  Two pair
scores the sum of the dice if two dice show the same number x and two
other dice show the same number y and 0 otherwise (it may be that x =
y, and the choice of four dice need not be unique, so four of a kind,
five of a kind, and full house all count as two pair).  Low straight
scores 25 points for 12345 in any order and 0 otherwise; high straight
scores 30 points for 23456 in any order and 0 otherwise.  Yatzie
scores 30 plus the sum of the dice for five of a kind and 0 otherwise.
Yortzee scores 15 points if all 5 dice are different (which includes
straights) and 0 otherwise.

There are two types of bonuses.  Like Yahtzee, Yortzee awards an
upper bonus for high subtotals in Aces through Sixes.  The upper bonus
is tiered: 15 points for 42-62; 35 points for 63-83; 55 points for 84-104;
and 75 points for 105.

There is also a bonus after scoring a non-zero value in Yortzee for
subsequent Yortzees used in other categories: if the Yortzee earns
a non-zero score in the chosen category then the bonus is awarded.
The bonuses grow progressively higher: the first bonus is 5 points,
the second is 10 points, the third is 15 points, and so on (so three
bonus Yortzees earn a total bonus of 5 + 10 + 15 = 30).
