            I discussed this assignment with: Vivek Katara, David Schwartz, Katherine Arackaparambil, ULA (Vishnu), Noah Ritz

Major Difficulties: I ended up scrapping a good deal of my code for a simpler implementation (more verbose) with stl::pair. I tried to create a user defined class for vertex (a maze being composed of vertices with direction, state, col/row) but after struggling to iterate through a vector of those types as well as getting my hash table to accept a user-defined type, I accepted Vishnu's suggestion of using std::pair to store most of the information. One bonus is that I get more exposure to stl containers, another being that other stl types like queues and unordered maps play well with the pair container. Vivek also clued me into using two Vertices as a key and two Vertices as a value for the hash table in order to trace back my path with BFS. Without that, I couldn't have guaranteed my solution was a unique one.
